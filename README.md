# cube_netmanager

Managing networks for multiple scenarios or planning years can be a difficult
data management problem. Keeping multiple copies of networks means that corrections to one network cannot be automatically propagated, or that running different combinations of facilities requires multiple scenario networks.

Keeping all the network data in a single location, on the other hand, creates
data management issues as well. An infrastructure needs to handle extracting the
appropriate projects from a master network and placing the correct scenario
network in the right place.

This project contains a stand-alone Cube catalog and application that generates
a scenario network from a master network based on a list of projects provided in
the catalog keys.
